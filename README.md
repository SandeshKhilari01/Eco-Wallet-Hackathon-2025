## Problem Statement

Walmart customers want to shop sustainably but often lack the tools or transparency to identify low-impact products. Despite Walmart’s ambitious sustainability goals under Project Gigaton, customer involvement is limited due to this gap.

---

## Solution Overview

EcoCart bridges this gap with a smart AI system that analyzes:
- Material composition
- Packaging types
- Carbon emissions per product
- Supply chain transport modes

The system then recommends greener alternatives in real time—making it easy for users to make climate-conscious decisions.

## How It Works

1. Products are tagged with environmental metadata.
2. AI model computes a sustainability score per product.
3. When a user views or purchases an item, the system suggests a better alternative based on:
   - Emissions
   - Packaging waste
   - Transport method and distance
4. The user is shown a transparent comparison and can choose the greener product.
